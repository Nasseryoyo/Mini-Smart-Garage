## Mini-Smart-Garage
This project is a garage door opener that also counts the number of cars entering the garage and displays the count on a seven-segment display. The opener is based on an MAX 10 Altera FPGA board and uses sensors to detect cars.

### Hardware

The following hardware is required for the project:

* MAX 10 Altera FPGA board
* Sensors
* Seven-segment display

### Software

The following software is required for the project:
* Quartus Prime Lite Edition
* Arduino IDE

### Functionality

The opener works by detecting cars using sensors. When a car is detected, the count is incremented and the door is opened. The count is displayed on a seven-segment display.

### Benefits

This project offers several benefits, including:

* Convenience: The opener can be opened from the comfort of your car.
* Security: The opener is only activated when a car is detected.
